            <ul>
              <li>Longbow (150/600) +14 to hit, 1d8, 2d6 + 4</li>
              <li>1d8 piercing and 2d6 (acid, fire, cold, lightning) damage</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <h4>Stormpiercer (Legendary)</h4>
            <p>Requires attunement, +11 to hit, 1d8 + 4</p>

            <h6>Abilities</h6>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Lightning Strike:</strong> - When an arrow is loosed
                from Stormpiercer, it turns into a bolt of lightning. On a hit,
                the arrow deals an additional 2d6 lightning damage. If it
                misses, the lightning still arcs, dealing half damage to the
                target.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Thunderous Shot:</strong> - Once per long rest,
                Stormpiercer can fire a thunderous arrow. On a hit, it creates a
                concussive wave that forces all creatures within 10 feet of the
                target to make a **Strength saving throw (DC 15) or be knocked
                prone. This shot also deals an additional 3d6 thunder damage to
                the target.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Storm's Fury (Active Ability)</strong> - As a bonus
                action, the wielder can invoke the power of the storm, weathing
                Strompiercing in a swirling vortex of wind and lightning for 1
                minute. During this time each arrow fired from the bow strikes
                multiple enemies, jumping up to two additional targets within 15
                feet of the original. Each target takes 1d6 lightning damage.
                This ability can be used once a day.
              </li>
            </ul>

          <h4>Ensnaring Strike</h4>
          <h6>Concentration up to 1 min, Bonus action, Self, V</h6>
          <p>
            As you hit the target, grasping vines appear on it, and it makes a
            Strength saving throw. A Large or larger creature has Advantage on
            this save. On a failed save, the target has the Restrained condition

            damage at the start of each of its turns. The target or a creature
            within reach of it can take an action to make a Strength (Athletics)
            check against your spell save DC. On a success, the spell ends.

          <p>
            You choose a creature you can see within range and mystically mark
            it as your quarry. Until the spell ends, you deal an extra 1d6
            damage to the target whenever you hit it with a weapon attack, and
            you have advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Survival)
            check you make to find it. If the target drops to 0 hit points
            before this spell ends, you can use a bonus action on a subsequent
            turn of yours to mark a new creature. At Higher Levels: When you
            cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd or 4th level, you can

            You move like the wind. For the duration, your movement doesn’t
            provoke opportunity attacks. Once before the spell ends, you can
            give yourself advantage on one weapon attack roll on your turn. That
            attack deals an extra 1d8 force damage on a hit. Whether you hit or

          <h6>Concentration up to 1 min, Bonus action, Self, V</h6>
          <p>
            You call forth a nature spirit to soothe the wounded. The intangible
            spirit appears in a space that is a 5-foot cube you can see within
            range. The spirit looks like a transparent beast or fey (your
            choice). Until the spell ends, whenever you or a creature you can
            see moves into the spirit's space for the first time on a turn or
            starts its turn there, you can cause the spirit to restore 1d6 hit
            points to that creature (no action required). The spirit can’t heal
            constructs or undead. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move
            the Spirit up to 30 feet to a space you can see. The spirit can heal
            a number of times equal to 1 + your spellcasting ability modifier
            (minimum of twice). After healing that number of times, the spirit
            disappears. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
            slot of 3rd level or higher, the healing increases 1d6 for each slot
            level above 2nd.

          <p>
            A veil of shadows and silence radiates from you, masking you and
            your companions from detection. For the duration, each creature you
            choose within 30 feet of you (including you) has a +10 bonus to
            Dexterity (Stealth) checks and can’t be tracked except by magical
            means. A creature that receives this bonus leaves behind no tracks

          <h6>Concentration up to 1 min, 1 Action, Self, V,S</h6>
          <p>
            The billowing flames of a dragon blast from your feet, granting you
            explosive speed. For the duration, your speed increases by 20 feet
            and moving doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks. When you move within
            5 feet of a creature or an object that isn’t being worn or carried,
            it takes 1d6 fire damage from your trail of heat. A creature or
            object can take this damage only once during a turn. At Higher
            Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or
            higher, increase your speed by 5 feet for each spell slot level

            You touch a creature and can end either one disease or one condition

          <p>
            The next time you make a ranged weapon attack during the spell’s
            duration, the weapon’s ammunition, or the weapon itself if it’s a
            thrown weapon, transforms into a bolt of lightning. Make the attack
            roll as normal. The target takes 4d8 lightning damage on a hit, or
            half as much damage on a miss, instead of the weapon’s normal
            damage. Whether you hit or miss, each creature within 10 feet of the
            target must make a Dexterity saving throw. Each of these creatures
            takes 2d8 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage
            on a successful one. The piece of ammunition or weapon then returns
            to its normal form. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
            a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage for both effects of
            the spell increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.

                  minute As you hit the target, grasping vines appear on it, and
                  it makes a Strength saving throw. A Large or larger creature
                  has Advantage on this save. On a failed save, the target has
                  the Restrained condition until the spell ends. On a successful
                  save, the vines shrivel away, and the spell ends. While
                  Restrained, the target takes 1d6 Piercing damage at the start
                  of each of its turns. The target or a creature within reach of
                  it can take an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check
                  against your spell save DC. On a success, the spell ends.
                  Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The damage increases by 1d6
                  for each spell slot level above 1.
